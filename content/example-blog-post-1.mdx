# Getting Started with Next.js 14 and TypeScript

Next.js 14 brings powerful new features that make building web applications easier and more efficient than ever. In this post, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## Why Next.js 14?

Next.js has become the go-to framework for React developers, and version 14 introduces several improvements:

- **App Router**: A new, more intuitive way to structure your application
- **Server Components**: Better performance with less JavaScript sent to the client
- **Improved Performance**: Faster builds and better optimization
- **TypeScript**: First-class TypeScript support out of the box

## Setting Up Your Project

Getting started is simple:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This creates a new Next.js project with TypeScript already configured.

## Key Features

### 1. App Router

The new App Router provides a more intuitive file-system based routing:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Welcome to Next.js 14!</h1>
}
```

### 2. Server Components

By default, components are Server Components, which means they render on the server:

```typescript
// app/users/page.tsx
async function getUsers() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function UsersPage() {
  const users = await getUsers()
  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### 3. Client Components

When you need interactivity, use the `'use client'` directive:

```typescript
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when you need interactivity
2. **Leverage TypeScript** - Strong typing helps catch errors early
3. **Optimize Images** - Use the `next/image` component for automatic optimization
4. **Code Splitting** - Next.js automatically splits your code for better performance

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 with TypeScript provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. The combination of Server Components, the App Router, and TypeScript creates a developer experience that's both productive and enjoyable.
