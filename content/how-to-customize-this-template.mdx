# How to Customize This Portfolio Template

Welcome to your new portfolio! This guide will walk you through customizing this template to showcase your unique work and personality.

## 📝 Step 1: Update Your Personal Information

The main configuration file is located at `src/data/resume.tsx`. This is where you'll update most of your personal information.

### Basic Information

```typescript
export const DATA = {
  name: "Your Full Name",
  initials: "YN",
  url: "https://yourwebsite.com",
  location: "Your City, State/Country",
  description: "Your professional title or tagline",
  summary: "A brief summary about yourself...",
  avatarUrl: "/your-photo.jpg",
  // ...
}
```

### Contact Information

Update your email and social media links:

```typescript
contact: {
  email: "your.email@example.com",
  social: {
    GitHub: {
      url: "https://github.com/yourusername",
      // ...
    },
    LinkedIn: {
      url: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername",
      // ...
    },
  },
}
```

## 🎨 Step 2: Add Your Photo

1. Replace the file at `/public/pfp.jpeg` with your own photo
2. Make sure it's a square image (recommended: 400x400px or larger)
3. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, or WEBP

## 💼 Step 3: Update Work Experience

In the `work` array, add your work experiences:

```typescript
work: [
  {
    company: "Company Name",
    href: "https://company.com",
    badges: ["Full-time", "Remote"],
    location: "City, Country",
    title: "Your Job Title",
    logoUrl: companyLogo, // or use a path to logo
    start: "Jan 2023",
    end: "Present",
    description: "Brief description of your role...",
    tasks: [
      {
        description: "Key achievement or responsibility",
        skills: ["React", "Node.js", "AWS"]
      },
      // Add more tasks
    ]
  },
  // Add more work experiences
]
```

## 🎓 Step 4: Add Education

Update the `education` array with your academic background:

```typescript
education: [
  {
    school: "University Name",
    href: "https://university.edu",
    degree: "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science",
    logoUrl: universityLogo,
    start: "2019",
    end: "2023",
  },
]
```

## 🚀 Step 5: Showcase Your Projects

This is where you shine! Add your projects to the `projects` array:

```typescript
projects: [
  {
    title: "Project Name",
    href: "https://github.com/yourusername/project",
    dates: "2024",
    active: true,
    description:
      "Detailed description of what your project does and the problem it solves.",
    technologies: [
      "React",
      "TypeScript",
      "Node.js",
      "PostgreSQL",
    ],
    links: [
      {
        type: "Website",
        href: "https://yourproject.com",
        icon: <Icons.globe className="size-3" />,
      },
      {
        type: "GitHub",
        href: "https://github.com/yourusername/project",
        icon: <Icons.github className="size-3" />,
      },
    ],
    image: "/projects/project-screenshot.png", // optional
  },
]
```

### Project Tips

- **Be specific**: Include metrics and results (e.g., "Improved performance by 40%")
- **Show impact**: Explain what problem your project solves
- **Add links**: GitHub repos, live demos, or case studies
- **Use keywords**: Include relevant technologies for SEO

## ✍️ Step 6: Write Blog Posts

Create MDX files in the `content/` directory:

### Creating a New Post

1. Create a new file: `content/your-post-title.mdx`
2. Add frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
publishedAt: "2024-01-15"
summary: "A brief summary of your post for preview cards"
---

# Your Blog Post Title

Your content here...

## Section Headers

Regular markdown content works great!

### Code Examples

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!")
}
```
```

### Blog Post Ideas

- Technical tutorials
- Project case studies
- Things you learned
- Industry insights
- Tools and resources you love

## 🎨 Step 7: Customize Colors & Styling (Optional)

### Changing the Color Scheme

This template comes with a modern **blue accent color** by default, but you can easily customize it!

Edit `src/app/globals.css` to change colors:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;  /* This is the main accent color */
  --background: 0 0% 100%;        /* Background color */
  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;   /* Text color */
  /* ... other colors */
}
```

**Popular alternatives:**

- **Purple Theme**: `--primary: 262.1 83.3% 57.8%;`
- **Green Theme**: `--primary: 142.1 76.2% 36.3%;`
- **Orange Theme**: `--primary: 24.6 95% 53.1%;`
- **Pink Theme**: `--primary: 346.8 77.2% 49.8%;`

**Pro Tip**: Use [UI Colors](https://uicolors.app/) to generate a complete color palette!

### Fonts

Update fonts in `src/app/layout.tsx`:

```typescript
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
```

## 🚢 Step 8: Deploy Your Portfolio

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and deploy!

### Custom Domain

1. Purchase a domain from a registrar
2. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS records as instructed

### Environment Variables

If you add any API keys or secrets:

1. Create a `.env.local` file (never commit this!)
2. Add the same variables in Vercel project settings
