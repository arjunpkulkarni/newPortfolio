## 2. About Section (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
I build real-time intelligent systems — AI agents, full-stack apps, and high-velocity mobile experiences.

Currently shipping features at Rumor (50k+ users), I was previously the first founding engineer at Curator.to (Intel & UpHonest Capital backed, helped raise $1M). My work spans:

• Agentic e-commerce: Built systems handling 2k+ daily queries with vector search, cutting p95 latency by 30%
• Clinical AI: Deployed UCSD Health's dietician platform with 22% accuracy improvement via RAG + LangChain
• Autonomous systems: Developed RL + MPC framework achieving 18% lower traffic delay in open-world simulations
• Mobile engineering: Shipped React Native features improving performance by 30% for 50k+ users

I thrive at the intersection of AI infrastructure, systems engineering, and product — solving real problems at scale. Also researching nanofluidic energy harvesting at UIUC's Micro/Nano Lab, because the best software engineers understand hardware.

Dual degree in Computer Science + Materials Engineering at UIUC.

Open to roles in AI engineering, full-stack systems, and ML infrastructure — especially in NYC, SF, or remote.

Let's build something meaningful together.
