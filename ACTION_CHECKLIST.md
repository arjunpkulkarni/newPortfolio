## 🎓 Pro Tips

### Getting Screenshots for Portfolio
1. **Rumor**: Ask your manager if you can screenshot non-sensitive features for your portfolio
2. **Curator.to**: Use public-facing demo or ask for permission
3. **UCSD Health**: Only use non-PHI (de-identified) screenshots, get written permission
4. **AbbVie**: Do NOT screenshot anything proprietary — use architecture diagrams instead

### Templates for Requesting Permission
**Email to supervisor:**
> Subject: Portfolio Screenshot Request
> 
> Hi [Name],
> 
> I'm updating my portfolio website and would love to showcase the work we did at [Company]. Would it be okay to include a screenshot of [specific feature/interface]? I'll ensure no sensitive data is visible.
> 
> If not, I'm happy to create a mockup or generic diagram instead.
> 
> Thanks!
> Arjun

### Getting Recommendations
**LinkedIn message:**
> Hi [Name],
> 
> I hope you're doing well! I'm updating my LinkedIn and would greatly appreciate a recommendation highlighting our work together at [Company].
> 
> If it helps, here's what I'd love you to mention:
> - [Specific achievement, e.g., "30% performance improvement on mobile features"]
> - [Impact, e.g., "helped scale platform to 50k+ users"]
> - [Soft skill, e.g., "collaborative", "took initiative"]
> 
> Happy to draft something for you to edit if that's easier!
> 
> Thank you so much,
> Arjun

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't** use generic buzzwords ("passionate", "innovative", "team player")
✅ **Do** use specific metrics ("30% faster", "$1M raised", "50k+ users")

❌ **Don't** list every technology you've ever touched
✅ **Do** focus on technologies you'd use in your next role

❌ **Don't** write long paragraphs on LinkedIn
✅ **Do** use bullet points with clear impact statements

❌ **Don't** apply to 100 jobs with a spray-and-pray approach
✅ **Do** target 10-15 companies and personalize each application

❌ **Don't** wait for everything to be perfect before updating
✅ **Do** update iteratively (LinkedIn today, screenshots next week, etc.)
